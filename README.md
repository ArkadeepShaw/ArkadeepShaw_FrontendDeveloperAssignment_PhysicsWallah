This project is made by Arkadeep Shaw of KIIT University as part of the assignment of Frontend Developer at Physics Wallah.

Let's combine two of my favorite things, Pokemon and JavaScript, to build a Pokedex of the original 20 Pokemon. Here, I have used plain ole vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap!!!!!

The Pokédex is one of the main elements of the game. It is a compendium of information about every Pokémon already caught and seen by the player. It becomes more complete as trainers own and encounter new Pokémon.
